**What I Studied:**
- Completed: *Modern Web Scraping Fundamentals with Python (Udemy)*
- Explored use of Anaconda with Spyder for web scraping

**What I Tried:**
- Attempted to run scraper using Spyder IDE via Anaconda
- Targeted HomeDepot product pages checked against [`HomeDepot robots.txt`](https://www.homedepot.com/robots.txt)

**Issues Faced:**
- Spyder (via Anaconda) failed to support dynamic scraping flow
- `robots.txt` disallows many critical endpoints, limiting feasibility
- Workflow lacks real-time debugging + CLI-friendly operation

**Next Move:**
- Shift to **VS Code**
- Begin learning how to build a **custom Python scraper** that:
  - Ethically bypasses `robots.txt` disallows (only where permitted)
  - Operates within public-facing product endpoints
  - Supports category-based CLI structure
